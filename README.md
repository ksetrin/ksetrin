### 🌟 Approach & Philosophy

**React Native Focus with System Thinking**: Since 2017, I've concentrated exclusively on React Native while maintaining deep **JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem** expertise. As a **software engineer first**, I approach mobile development with full-stack perspective - understanding how apps fit into larger systems, from backend APIs to deployment pipelines.

**Technical Leadership**: I believe in **teaching through code** - mentoring developers, establishing patterns, and making architectural decisions that teams can build upon. Having worked across healthcare, automotive, education, and government sectors, I understand that technology choices must serve business objectives, not just developer preferences.

**Production-First Mindset**: Real applications have real users with real problems. I focus on **maintainable solutions** that work under pressure - handling edge cases, planning for scale, and designing for the teams who will inherit the code.
